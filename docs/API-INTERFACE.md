## User API
The User API is intended to be outward facing and available for anyone to code and interact with.  Version 0 provides the minimum functionality necessary to place orders, view orders, determine available products from a list of inputs and determine available projections with their associated parameters/value ranges.

Additional functionality may be added in later releases.  Some of these items include allowing users to search rather than requiring a scene list as input, allowing users to search and/or clip to predefined grid & tile extents (example: find all scenes that have data in the extents defined by WELD CONUS Tile h01v03 where cloud cover is less than x% and the observation month is June, July or August), or caching/identifying ESPA outputs that could be reused in another order.

Users may also want to specify an output file naming scheme that could be provided via templating and captured at order submission time.  None of these items are addressed in version 0.

```

```POST /api/v0/available-products```
* Returns available output products for the input products specified in the body.  Needed to build intelligent clients.

    "processing@email.com-101115143201-00132"
  ]
}

## Production API
The Production API is intended to be used by the system or systems that are fulfilling the end user production requests.  As such, the API simply allows production systems to retrieve items to process and then update their status.  There is also a method for retrieving configuration data.
