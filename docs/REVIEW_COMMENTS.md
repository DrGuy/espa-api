1. Any external service calls ESPA makes needs to employ caching
2. Provide an 'expires' field on orders for when they will be removed from cache
3. Distribution of orders fulfilled by ESPA need to remain with ESPA.  That is, if users place orders through an
client that uses ESPA for fulfillment, then the users should ultimately wind up obtaining their completed orders from 
the ESPA website itself.
